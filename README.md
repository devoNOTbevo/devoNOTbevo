# Hello there :wave:!
I'm Devon and I'm a Software Solutions Consultant and CTO. 

I work primarily in JavaScript (React, Vue) and PHP (Laravel) frameworks building cloud-native web applications.

My aim is to be an engineer who does their best work on products/solutions that really matter. And empower others to do the same.
